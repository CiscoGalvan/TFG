The art of making a video game is the homogeneous combination of various arts to create an interactive experience. Among these parts we find art, sound, programming and design. When it comes to making art, humans have always used tools which they have made themselves and which have helped them to carry out tasks more efficiently and accurately.
When making a video game of any kind, the team behind the work has to make two ideas clear to the player: the objective of the game and the obstacles that the player will have to face to achieve it. With special emphasis on the type of games analyzed in this work, the main obstacle will be enemies, and for them to be a challenge for the player they must have an artificial intelligence according to the game design. \\\\ 

The objective of this work is to create a tool whose purpose is to generate enemies for 2D platform video games. For this purpose, a catalog of components for Unity will be created with which to create, without previous programming knowledge, enemy artificial intelligences. This catalog of components is the result of our research work and subsequent abstraction of enemy behaviors in 2D platform games.
