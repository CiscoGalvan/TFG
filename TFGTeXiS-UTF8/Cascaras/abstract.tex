\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}
Video games are becoming more and more sophisticated, combining various disciplines such as art, sound, programming and design. In addition, the objective of the video game and the obstacles to be overcome must be clear all the time. Specifically in 2D platformers, enemies represent the main obstacle for the player. With such sophistication, the industry is becoming more and more technical and the design of enemies more complex, causing the need for profiles with knowledge in other areas to be able to design enemies. To avoid this problem, the need arises to create an accessible tool that allows designing enemies without the technical barrier. To address this problem, a catalog of components for Unity will be developed to facilitate the creation of enemy behaviors in 2D platform games, based on an abstraction of behavior patterns identified in this type of games.
